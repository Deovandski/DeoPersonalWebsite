						<p>Long time ago when version 0.x dominated the KSP universe, there was a newbie who decided to purchase a copy of this game due to the interesting concept behing it.
						Forward two years, and you would see a not-so-newbie developer who is amazed by how the community and game grew.
						The growth followed pretty much the same rate as his gut growth due to the lack of exercise and overeating due to college and work.</p>
						<p>However, 2016 is not simply the end of this nerdy history, but actually a new start for both the game and the developer playing it!
						The developer is losing weight and the game is reaching a new phase of being ported to Unity 5 which will allow it to reach console players and not only the "PC Master Race" players.</p>
