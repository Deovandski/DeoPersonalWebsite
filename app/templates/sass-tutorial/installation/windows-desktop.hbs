<p>Koala's main functionality is to be the compiler for SASS and to automatically compile and output errors as you make changes to the tracked scss files as long as it is running on the background. It also gives you an option to remember project locations so that subsequent uses are as painless as possible...</p>
<p>In order to make the installation tutorial easier to follow since it is almost a tutorial within a tutorial, I created a Google Slides that can be viewed below or at anytime through this <a class="button2" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z4V_zIuWuJkvAGUxMo5ahwBBeLTw3K7qCylAZVe_YMY/edit?usp=sharing">website</a>.</p>

<p>Did the example website worked as expected? If so, then it is time to start diving deep into scss and learn about imports and variables:</p>
