			<p>If you have a Rails project or other web based projects, then most likely SASS and all of its dependencies is automatically taken care of and compiled into CSS when you build your server as long as you declare the required gems.</p>

It also gives you an option to remember project locations so that subsequent uses are as painless as possible...</p>
			<p>In order to make the installation tutorial easier to follow since it is almost a tutorial within a tutorial, I created a Google Slides that can be viewed below or at anytime through this <a class="button2" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z4V_zIuWuJkvAGUxMo5ahwBBeLTw3K7qCylAZVe_YMY/edit?usp=sharing">website</a>.</p>

			<p>Did the example website worked as expected? If so, then it is time to start diving deep into scss and learn about imports and variables:</p>
